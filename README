These are some parts of the UEFI ROM for the
Lenovo ideapad 330-15IKB (Type 81FD) laptop.

Warning: This should only be used for
information and learning purposes only. Do
not try to modify or flash these binaries,
because the binary list present on this repo
is incomplete. I should upload the vast
majority of the files, but do not dare to do
what I said before. It is not for your
laptop, even if it matches the same model
and specs. The brazilian model is very
different on the insides, and I don't know
if they modified something in the UEFI
firmware to acknowledge these changes.
